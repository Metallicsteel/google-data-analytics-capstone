This project is part of my **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** portfolio.  
It demonstrates the full data analysis process â€” from **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act** â€” on the popular **Hotel Bookings dataset**.

2. **Prepare**: Load and clean 119,390 rows of hotel booking data.  
3. **Process**: Feature engineering (lead time, customer type, ADR, etc.).  
4. **Analyze**: Descriptive statistics and trend analysis with Python.  
5. **Share**: Visualizations (see below).  
6. **Act**: Recommendations to reduce cancellations and optimize revenue.
